# spinnaker-tools
* TODO: Support non-admin creds
* TODO: Switch to k8s bindings
* TODO: Lots of other tests and bugfixes and improvements

This is currently very rough and is essentially an MVP.  Needs a decent amount of refactoring, and we need to add more parameters so this can be fully automated.

## Build

```bash
git clone git@github.com:armory/spinnaker-tools.git

cd spinnaker-tools

go mod download all

go build
```
